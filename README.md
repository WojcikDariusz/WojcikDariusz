### Hi I'm Darek ðŸ‘‹ 

Currently I'm building production ready React & Node.js application for the Research Institute to help scientists browse through their big collection of datasets.
Most of my code, here is proprietary and therefore it's not publically accessible.
Besides Software Engineering I work with seismic signal processing, modeling and interpretation on a daily basis âš¡
