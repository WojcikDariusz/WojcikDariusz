### Hi I'm Darek ðŸ‘‹ 

Currently I'm building production ready React & Node.js application for the Research Institute to help scientists browse through their big collection of datasets.

Besides Software Engineering I work with seismic signal processing, modeling and interpretation on a daily basis âš¡

Most of my repos are proprietary and therefore code it's not publically accessible.
